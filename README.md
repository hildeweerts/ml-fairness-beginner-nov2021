# An Introduction to Fairness in Machine Learning using Fairlearn
### Level: Beginner 
### Presentation: [introduction to fairness](workshop/fairnessbeginner.pptx)

## Workshop description
In the past few years there has been an increasing awareness amongst both the public and scientific community that algorithmic systems can reproduce, amplify, or even introduce unfairness in our societies. During the workshop, you will learn how to assess the fairness of machine learning models and how to choose an appropriate fairness metric for your use case.

## Requirements
Set up a Python 3 environment that can run Jupyter notebooks (Jupyter or Jupyterlab) and install the following libraries, e.g., using `pip`:

* matplotlib
* fairlearn

See also the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage
* Clone the repository
* Start jupyter(lab) and navigate to the workshop folder
